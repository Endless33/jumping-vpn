# VRP Protocol SpecificationThis directory contains the official documentation for VRP (Veil Routing Protocol) — a new privacy protocol based on dynamic routing, blind-node logic, and client‑driven mutation.## Documents- architecture_overview.md — high‑level structure of VRP  - mutation_flow.md — how routes mutate and why motion equals privacy  - blind_node_model.md — why nodes have no global knowledge  - client_authority.md — client‑driven routing and mutation logic  - transparency_policy.md — what is open and what is closed  ## PurposeThe goal of this directory is to define VRP as a protocol, not just an implementation.  It establishes the principles, behavior, and philosophy behind Jumping VPN.## StatusVRP is under active development.  The specification will evolve as the protocol matures.

Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on stable tunnels and fixed routes, VRP introduces dynamic mutation, blind-node logic, and client-authority control.## Core Principles- Motion equals privacy — static routes are vulnerable; dynamic behavior creates unpredictability.- Blind-node model — no node knows the full path; each node sees only its immediate neighbor.- Client-authority — the client defines the route logic and mutation behavior.- Mutation flow — routes mutate over time, preventing long-term traceability.## Components- VRP Client — initiates connection, controls mutation, and manages handshake logic.- VRP Node — relays traffic blindly, without knowledge of origin or destination.- VRP Authority — optional coordination layer for route logic and mutation rules.## Behavior Model- Routes are never stable.- Each packet may follow a different path.- Nodes do not retain session state.- Mutation is continuous and client-driven.## StatusThis document is part of an evolving protocol.  VRP is currently in architectural definition phase.---Jumping VPN is the first implementation of VRP, designed to demonstrate the protocol's behavior and philosophy.
