Jumping VPN is the first client built on top of VRP — the Veil Routing Protocol.It doesn’t just tunnel traffic. It demonstrates what a privacy-first routing system can become when behavior replaces static paths.

This client showcases:

dynamic route mutation

blind-node behavior

entropy-driven path selection

session-level unpredictability

separation of roles (ENTRY / MIDDLE / EXIT)

resistance to correlation and analysis

Jumping VPN is not a product.It’s a living demonstration of how VRP behaves in motion —a proof-of-concept for a protocol that refuses to be predictable.
