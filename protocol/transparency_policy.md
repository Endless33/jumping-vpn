# Transparency Policy

Jumping VPN and VRP follow a clear architectural transparency model.  
Certain components are open and public to support trust, collaboration, and protocol legitimacy.  
Other components are intentionally closed to protect security, integrity, and commercial viability.

## ✔ Public and Open

The following elements are open-source and publicly documented:

- VRP specification
- Architecture overview
- Protocol documentation
- Client code
- Node code
- Example scenarios and flows

These components define the protocol and demonstrate its behavior.  
They are open to inspection, contribution, and discussion.

## ❌ Private and Closed

The following elements are intentionally closed:

- Commercial logic of Jumping VPN
- Cryptographic keys
- Configuration files
- Server infrastructure
- Business model
- Private repositories

These components are protected to maintain operational security and strategic control.

## Philosophy

This policy ensures that VRP is seen as a protocol — not just a product.  
It balances openness with protection, and movement-building with architectural discipline.
