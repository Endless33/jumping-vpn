# VRP Limitations

Every protocol has boundaries.  
VRP provides strong privacy through motion, unpredictability, and decentralization — but it is not a universal solution.

This document outlines the known limitations of VRP.

## 1. Client-Side Complexity

VRP places responsibility on the client:
- route selection,
- mutation logic,
- node management.

This increases client complexity compared to traditional VPNs.

## 2. Performance Variability

Because routes mutate:
- latency may fluctuate,
- throughput may vary,
- stability is not guaranteed.

VRP prioritizes privacy over performance.

## 3. No Protection Against Compromised Devices

VRP cannot protect against:
- malware on the client,
- keyloggers,
- OS-level compromise.

If the device is compromised, privacy is compromised.

## 4. Not Designed for Low-Latency Real-Time Use

Continuous mutation may not be ideal for:
- competitive gaming,
- high-frequency trading,
- ultra-low-latency applications.

## 5. Requires a Node Ecosystem

VRP depends on:
- available nodes,
- geographic diversity,
- network distribution.

A small or centralized node pool reduces effectiveness.

## 6. Metadata Cannot Be Eliminated Completely

VRP minimizes metadata, but:
- packet timing still exists,
- network observers can still measure volume,
- global adversaries may attempt correlation.

Mutation makes correlation extremely difficult — but not impossible.

## Summary

VRP is powerful, but not magical.  
It is designed to maximize privacy through motion and decentralization, while accepting trade-offs in performance and simplicity.
