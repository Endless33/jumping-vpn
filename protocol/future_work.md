# VRP Future Work

VRP is an evolving protocol.  
This document outlines areas of ongoing research, planned improvements, and potential extensions.

## 1. Advanced Mutation Strategies

Future versions may include:
- adaptive mutation based on network conditions,
- multi-layer mutation (route + packet timing),
- machine-learning-assisted mutation heuristics.

## 2. Node Reputation and Scoring

Without central authority, VRP may explore:
- decentralized reputation models,
- trust scoring without identity,
- anomaly detection for malicious nodes.

## 3. Multi-Path Routing

Support for:
- sending packets across multiple routes simultaneously,
- splitting flows for additional unpredictability,
- dynamic path merging.

## 4. Pluggable Transports

VRP may support:
- QUIC-based transport,
- obfuscated transports,
- domain-fronting-like behavior,
- transport randomization.

## 5. Distributed Node Discovery

Future work includes:
- decentralized node lists,
- peer-to-peer discovery,
- gossip-based distribution.

## 6. Formal Verification

Long-term goals:
- formally verify mutation logic,
- prove privacy guarantees,
- model adversaries mathematically.

## 7. Hardware Acceleration

Exploring:
- offloading mutation logic,
- packet processing optimizations,
- embedded VRP clients.

## Summary

VRP is not static — it is a living protocol.  
Future work focuses on deeper decentralization, stronger unpredictability, and broader applicability.
