# VRP Protocol Specification

This directory contains the official documentation for VRP (Veil Routing Protocol) — a new privacy protocol based on dynamic routing, blind-node logic, and client‑driven mutation.

## Documents

- architecture_overview.md — high‑level structure of VRP  
- mutation_flow.md — how routes mutate and why motion equals privacy  
- blind_node_model.md — why nodes have no global knowledge  
- client_authority.md — client‑driven routing and mutation logic  
- transparency_policy.md — what is open and what is closed  

## Purpose

The goal of this directory is to define VRP as a protocol, not just an implementation.  
It establishes the principles, behavior, and philosophy behind Jumping VPN.

## Status

VRP is under active development.  
The specification will evolve as the protocol matures.
