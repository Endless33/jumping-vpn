# Support VRP

VRP is not a product. It’s a protocol.

If you believe in privacy-first infrastructure, dynamic routing, and open standards —  
you can support VRP as a steward, not an investor.

## Ways to Support

- Technical feedback on architecture
- Participation in simulation and modeling
- Infrastructure sponsorship (nodes, bandwidth, testing environments)
- Open-source stewardship
- Compliance and privacy alignment
- Quiet advisory (no public affiliation required)

## What We Don’t Seek

- No equity
- No control
- No productization pressure

## Contact

If you want to support VRP quietly or strategically, reach out via LinkedIn or GitHub Issues.
