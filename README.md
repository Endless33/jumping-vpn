# Jumping VPN

Jumping VPN is a client built on VRP (Veil Routing Protocol) — a new privacy protocol based on dynamic network behavior, route mutation, and blind-node logic.

VRP is not a traditional VPN protocol. It introduces a new model of privacy where motion equals protection, and routes are never stable, predictable, or traceable.

## Key Concepts

- Dynamic routing — the connection constantly mutates.
- Blind-node model — no single node knows the full path.
- Client-authority — the client controls the behavior, not the server.
- Movement as privacy — stability is vulnerability; motion is protection.

## Status

This repository will contain:
- VRP documentation
- Architecture overview
- Client prototype
- Node prototype
- Mutation flow diagrams

Work in progress. The protocol is evolving.

## Vision

Jumping VPN is not just a product — it is a movement toward a new category of privacy technology.
