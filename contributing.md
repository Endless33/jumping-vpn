# Contributing to Jumping VPN & VRP

Jumping VPN is the first client built on top of VRP — the Veil Routing Protocol.
This project is not a traditional VPN. It is a demonstration of dynamic routing,
blind-node behavior, mutation flow, and privacy-by-unpredictability.

If you want to contribute, here are the areas where help is welcome.

## 1. Rust Development (Core Client)
- Implementing the Jumping VPN client logic
- Integrating VRP route selection and mutation
- Building the session manager
- Handling multi-hop routing logic
- Implementing packet handling (non-cryptographic simulation)

## 2. VRP Simulation & Modeling
- Improving the dynamic routing simulation engine
- Adding new mutation strategies
- Enhancing node behavior models
- Extending session lifecycle logic
- Building visualization tools for route evolution

## 3. Architecture & Research
- Reviewing VRP documentation
- Suggesting improvements to protocol design
- Threat modeling and adversary analysis
- Regional diversity and node selection strategies
- Behavior-based privacy research

## 4. Infrastructure & Testing
- Running test nodes (simulation only)
- Stress-testing route mutation
- Benchmarking session rotation behavior
- Testing multi-region topologies

## 5. Documentation
- Improving protocol documentation
- Writing examples and diagrams
- Creating developer onboarding guides
- Translating documentation

## 6. Community & Stewardship
- Providing architectural feedback
- Quiet advisory (no public affiliation required)
- Helping shape VRP as an open protocol
- Supporting privacy-first infrastructure

## What We Do NOT Seek
- No investors
- No ownership requests
- No attempts to commercialize VRP
- No control over protocol direction
